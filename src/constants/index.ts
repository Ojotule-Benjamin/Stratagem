    article: `Next, we are splitting this string into an array of values. Each array item is created between each space. E.g “hello world” would become [“hello”, “world”].

    From this array, we have the number of words as the number of entries in the array. We'll set this number to the totalWords variable in state.
    
    The following step is an important one, we are looping through each word and if it's a multiple of 250 we are wrapping the word in an HTML span tag with a class of checkpoint and a data attribute of checkpoint and the current index of the counter.
    
    For example, the 250th word would be wrapped in a span with the data-checkpoint value of 1. 500th word would be a value of 2, etc.
    
    We'll be using these values and classes later to update the read time left.
    
    Next, we are merging our processed array of values back into a string as we originally had, but now with the span elements, we needed to wrap the text in.
    
    Before, finally, we set this parsed HTML string into the state variable 'parsed'.
