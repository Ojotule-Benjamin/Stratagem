    title: `Legal Tips`,
    article: `In 1999 Maduro was a member of the National Constituent Assembly that rewrote the constitution that was part of Chávez’s ascent to the presidency. That year Maduro also served in the Chamber of Deputies (the lower house of the Venezuelan legislature), which was eliminated when the legislature became the unicameral National Assembly, in which Maduro began serving in 2000. He was reelected in 2005 and served as the body’s president until 2006, when he became foreign minister. In that capacity he worked to advance the goals of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America (ALBA), which sought to increase social, political, and economic integration in Latin America and to blunt U.S. influence in the region. He also helped cultivate friendly relations for Venezuela with such controversial world leaders as Libya’s Muammar al-Qaddafi, Zimbabwe’s Robert Mugabe, and Iran’s Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
Maduro’s profile in the administration began to grow, especially as Chávez’s health began to deteriorate, beginning with Chávez’s initial announcement in 2011 that he had cancer. In October 2012, following Chávez’s triumph in the presidential election over Henrique Capriles Radonski, Maduro became vice president. At the same time, Maduro’s wife (herself a former president of the National Assembly) was serving as Venezuela’s attorney general, which led to the perception of the two as the country’s ultimate political power couple. Before leaving for another round of surgery in Cuba in December 2012, Chávez named Maduro as his preferred successor should he not survive. Indeed, while most of the world was kept in the dark regarding Chávez’s status during a postsurgery recovery in Cuba that forced the postponement of his inauguration in January 2013, Maduro, ever the loyal chavista, acted as the country’s de facto leader. His principal rival for power within the chavismo movement was the president of the National Assembly at that time, Diosdado Cabello, who was widely perceived as the favourite of the military, whereas Maduro was seen as having the support of Chávez’s pivotal ally the Castro regime in Cuba.
   
   Personal life:
   Maduro has been married twice. His first marriage was to Adriana Guerra Angulo, with whom he had his only son, Nicolás Maduro Guerra, also known as “Nicolasito”, who was appointed to several senior government posts (Chief of the Presidency’s Special Inspectors Body, head of the National Film School, and a seat in the National Assembly). He later married Cilia Flores, a lawyer and politician who replaced Maduro as president of the National Assembly in August 2006, when he resigned to become Minister of Foreign Affairs, becoming the first woman to serve as president of the National Assembly. The two had been in a romantic relationship since the 1990s when Flores was Hugo Chávez’s lawyer following the 1992 Venezuela coup d’état attempts and were married in July 2013 months after Maduro became president. While they have no children together, Maduro has three step-children from his wife’s first marriage to Walter Ramón Gavidia; Walter Jacob, Yoswel, and Yosser.
